### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Chris, a 19-year old game developer on Roblox with an interest in 3D modeling, animation, composing, and of course, programming!
I am currently a college freshman majoring in computer science, living on the hope that the things I learn on my path to earning a degree are worth more than the cost of my tuition.
